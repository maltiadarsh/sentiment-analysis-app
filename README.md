# Sentiment Analysis of Text Reviews (End-to-End Application)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A full-stack, end-to-end machine learning application that analyzes the sentiment of text reviews. This project includes a trained Scikit-learn model, a Flask REST API, a Streamlit web UI, and is fully containerized with Docker for deployment.

### üìñ Project Overview

This project provides a hands-on journey into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and MLOps. The goal was to build a sophisticated Sentiment Analysis application that can determine whether a piece of text (like a movie or product review) expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The project covers the entire ML lifecycle: data collection and cleaning, model training and evaluation, and finally, deployment as a containerized web service with a user-friendly interface.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Accurate Sentiment Prediction:** Utilizes a Logistic Regression model trained on the IMDb movie review dataset, achieving over 85% accuracy.
- **RESTful API:** A robust Flask API serves the model's predictions, making it accessible to any client application.
- **Interactive Web UI:** A user-friendly front-end built with Streamlit allows for easy, real-time sentiment analysis.
- **Containerized Deployment:** The entire backend service is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency and portability across environments.
- **Cloud-Hosted:** Deployed on Render, making the application publicly and reliably accessible.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is designed with a decoupled client-server architecture:

1.  **Backend (Flask API):** A production-ready web service that handles the machine learning logic.
    - It exposes a `/predict` endpoint.
    - It loads the pre-trained TF-IDF vectorizer and Logistic Regression model.
    - It preprocesses incoming text and returns a sentiment prediction in JSON format.
    - It is containerized by Docker and run with a Gunicorn WSGI server.
2.  **Frontend (Streamlit UI):** A separate, interactive web application that acts as a client to the backend.
    - It provides a text area for user input.
    - On submission, it makes an HTTP POST request to the Flask API.
    - It receives the JSON response and displays the result in a user-friendly, color-coded format.
